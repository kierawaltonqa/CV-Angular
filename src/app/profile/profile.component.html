        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>It is my drive for answers and love for problem solving which have led me to pursue a career in the technical
            industry. Throughout my three years spent studying Maths and Philosophy at university, I was able to push
            the
            limits of my own understanding, question the unknown, and take creative approaches to provide the best
            solutions
            to various problems. The interdisciplinary nature of this degree has enabled me to possess a set of
            transferrable critical thinking skills and develop an analytic and innovative mindset – it is these skills
            which
            provide a foundation for my technical competency. Upon taking up the challenge of learning Python after
            graduating, I realised my ability and passion for IT; the skills I possess - my desire for understanding and
            naturally curious mindset, my problem-solving skills, my analytical ability – provide me with an attuned way
            of
            tackling technical problems and implementing logic into systems and software to achieve results. </p>
